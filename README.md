# pathfinder

This is a **visualization** of the two most popular pathfinding algorythms in the world: BFS-Search and A*-Search.
It runs in python with the framework QT. 

# Get started
- install Qt on your machine (if you haven't already :))
- install qtpy from the python package manager (pip)
- download the source files into the folder you have installed qtpy in
- run the command "python script.py" to start



The pathfinder allows users to navigate through labyrinths from a **start point** to an **end point**. 
You can add **walls** to the grid by simply pressing down any key on your mouse. When all walls are set, let the pathfinder find its way through the labyrinth for you!


By clicking on the Button **"Change Algorythm"**, the software will swap its algorythm. You can choose between a **bfs-Search** (breadth-first-search) and an **A*-Algorythm** (this one is faster and more efficient!)


But how to **change the speed** of the animation?
You can do that by sliding the slider at the top and you can even **zoom in** or **zoom out**! (when in start-mode)

You can even generate **complex labyrinths** by clicking the button "create complex labyrinth", provided the software is in start-mode or in config-mode.


Have Fun! :)
