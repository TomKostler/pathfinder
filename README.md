# pathfinder

This pathfinder allows users to navigate through labyrinths from a **start point** to an **end point**. 
You can add **walls** to the grid by simply pressing down any key on your mouse. When all walls are set, let the pathfinder find its way through the labyrinth for you!


By clicking on the Button **"Change Algorythm"**, the software will swap its algorythm. You can choose between a **bfs-Search** (breadth-first-search) and an **A*-Algorythm** (this one is faster and more efficient!)


But how to **change the speed** of the animation?
You can do that by sliding the slider at the top and you can even **zoom in** or **zoom out**! (Provided that there is no animation running)


Have Fun! :)
